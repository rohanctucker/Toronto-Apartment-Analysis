With a view of the city and easy access to everything in the annex area. What is included is heat water hydro/electricity. What you May pay for/set up is internet (it is wired and ready to go, but you will be solely responsible for that). There is no dishwasher. There is coin laundry in the building. There is an elevator. No parking. It is a 6 minute walk to the Bloor spadina subway and metro gerocery store. There are so many great places to eat, librarys, museums, arts, theatre - shopping and entertainment in the area. You are very close to yorkville too.
The location is fantastic! The apartment is fairly spacious for 1 bathroom including tub, 1 bedroom with a very comfortable queen size bed, two side tables and closet. The kitchen is half open concept with two stools for the island, a dining table off to the side, and living room. There is also a balcony, with a table and 2 chairs. There is a tv, but again, no cable and that would be part of the internet if you choose to hook it up and pay for a plan that works for you.
All in all, it is a great place to live in the city. Though do note it is an older building, so it does have that charm. They do keep it up with taking care of it. And you will be going through the building manager with her required paperwork and such to check that everything is in order for accountability & ID to know who is in the unit incase of an emergency. Though all payments will be going through myself and my mother, on which who’s behalf I am posting this add for the 1 time only - temporary 3 month sublet.
A $500 certified check is required for damages which will be returned to you upon seeing everything is as it was left. Along with the 1sts month payment immediately ($3,300) to hold it and the remainder ($6,600)the day before you will be moving in. Which we will have to arrange to get the elevator if you require it to be held for you.
The place is furnished so once we are further along in the process I can give you a more detailed list of items you will have access to. For example there is a microwave and basic kitchen ware. Serious inquiries only. No refunds. So the total amount is a certified cheque to be returned to you upon no damages/things left as they were found for $500, plus 3 months furnished rent ($3,300 x 3 = $9, 900).
March 15 is a possible start date - June 15 2024. No smoking, pets or children. Ideal for 1 person or a couple. I will be happy to answer questions for serious inquiries only.
